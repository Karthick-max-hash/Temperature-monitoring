# Temperature-monitoring# ðŸŒ¡ Temperature Monitoring System using LM35 and LED (Arduino + Tinkercad)

This project simulates a basic temperature monitoring system using an *TMD32 temperature sensor* and an *LED* with an *Arduino UNO* in *Tinkercad*.

When the temperature exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 30Â°C), the LED turns ON to indicate overheating. Otherwise, the LED remains OFF.

### ðŸ”¥ TMD32:
| TMD32 Pin | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| Left     | 5V         |
| Middle   | A0         |
| Right    | GND        |

### ðŸ’¡ LED:
| LED Pin   | Connection     |
|-----------|----------------|
| Anode (+) | Digital Pin 7 (through 220Î© resistor) |
| Cathode (â€“)| GND           |

## ðŸ§  Working Principle

- The *TMD32* outputs a voltage that increases with temperature (~10mV per Â°C).
- The Arduino reads the analog voltage on pin A0.
- It converts this to temperature in Celsius.
- If temperature > 30Â°C â†’ LED turns *ON*
- If temperature â‰¤ 30Â°C â†’ LED stays **OFF
